# Software-Verification-and-Testing

Software Verification, Validation, and Testing (CSE 565)
This repository contains projects demonstrating a wide range of software testing techniques and tools, completed as part of the Software Verification, Validation, and Testing course at ASU. These projects emphasize the practical application of testing methodologies to ensure software quality and reliability. Key projects include:

1. Unit Testing with Heapsort: Designed and implemented the Heapsort algorithm in Python, validating its correctness using the unittest framework with extensive test coverage, including generative AI for test case creation.

2. Specification-Based Testing: Applied equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, and cause-effect graphing to validate a Java-based discount calculation application. Identified critical defects and proposed actionable resolutions.

3. Design of Experiments (DOE): Utilized Microsoft's PICT tool and generative AI to generate pairwise combination test cases for a mobile application. Compared traditional and AI-driven approaches to achieve efficient and comprehensive test coverage.

4. Structural-Based Testing: Achieved high statement and branch coverage for a VendingMachine application using IntelliJ IDEA. Performed static code analysis with PMD to uncover and resolve coding anomalies.

5. GUI Testing: Automated testing for a web-based News Application using Cypress, evaluating functionality, usability, and resilience to intentional modifications across versions.

These projects highlight the integration of traditional and modern testing tools and techniques to ensure robust software quality assurance.
